# Python Programing Language

## What is Python?

Python is a programming language. It is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented, and dynamic programming language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It is also easy to learn.

## Keep in mind

2. Spacing is important. There will be no error if you do not use the correct indentation.
3. Use error messages to help you learn.
